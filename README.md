####layout
```
Layout is designed to have 5 separate sections, 3 primary
  -header and nav
  -hero (primary)
  -about me (primary)
  -contact (primary)
  -footer

The 3 primary sections are seperated by a break of a white bar with the following headder centered. This was designed to have a introduction (image and name), Information section (about me, photos, articles), and Contact area. Sub sections each have their own color as well. This was designed for easy usage so the view can swiftly subconciously know what they should expect in each area.
###logo
```
Custom logo made with my initials CD, simple and modern to be able to fit with the simplicity of the website
```

###Navigation Bar
```
Function: to auto-scroll to the desired section. Each section also has a 'back to top' button to allow easy access to the nav bar.

Design: highlighted on selection to notified that a selection was registered
```

###hero
```
Hero section has a image of my fraternity's house as the background for the section and is greyscaled to alow for the text to stand out. Text reads my name as it is the title of the page and a brief title. Wanted to add something more than the standard layout (from the starter code).
```

###About Me
```
Title: centered and headline has a distinct bar across to separate hero section from this section.

Main Content: Image of myself on the left with description on the right to break up the flow of the webpage. Background color breaks up the sections above and below it.
```

###Photo Gallery
```
Titled to the left and colored distinctly to separate section as its own. Images are separated and have their own background with a caption underneath to be designed similar to a physical scrapbook as the images are of a trip. Images also have a hover effect that enlarges them.
```

###Articles
```
Title: Centered to break up flow of the about sub-section.

Design: Darker background with white text to make it easier for viewers to read of off a screen. Each article starts with a drop cap effect that was designed to be subtle.

Article 1: CSS Filters
  -explain the usage of image filters in CSS and what to look out for
  -shows side by side example images of no filter and a blur filter
Article 2: Image Hover Effects
  -explains usage and mostly how designers should be focused on using these effects to enhance with a purpose
  -shows side by side example images of no effect and a fade in overlay effect
```

###Contact Form
```
Design: made to be simple and modern, easy to read and use, no confusion.

Function: Working form that sends an email through Formspree with the responses
```
